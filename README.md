<span style="font-size:14px;font-family:verdana">This mod is a shared code library. Its main function, for my mods, is to add the _"Great Chalice"_ block when the **"Knight Quest"** mod is not present, along with a few additional utilities. However, you're welcome to use this library in your own projects.</span>

<br>

### Why "Knight Lib"?
As I’m developing several mods (with more coming, especially related to the Knight Quest series), I decided that making the "Great Chalice" a mandatory dependency would prevent code duplication and provide a unified block for all my mods to use.

## **Developer information**

<br>

<span style="font-size:14px;font-family:verdana">If you're a developer and want to use this library in your development environment, you can follow the information located in the [wiki](https://github.com/Xylonity/Knight-Lib/wiki) section of the GitHub page for installation.</span>

### Why should you use this library over others? 

I’ve noticed many public _libraries_ and _APIs_ are either poorly documented or overloaded with unnecessary functionality/code. Here, I focus on clear documentation and useful features, making it lightweight and easy to use. It’s **compatible** with multiloader projects, giving access to _specific loaders_ and the _common_ class.
